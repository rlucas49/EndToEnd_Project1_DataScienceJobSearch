# EndToEnd_Project1_DataScienceJobSearch
An example of an end-to-end project from data ingest to visualization
It was created to demonstrate the approach of how to build out an end-to-end data science project. The goal is to showcase steps in a project including:

data wrangling,
simple data engineering,
some basic EDA,
an analysis,
a visualization,
handling secure access via a personal access token, and
some simple ML Ops.
The subject matter examines hypothetical data from a job search for a data scientist position.
